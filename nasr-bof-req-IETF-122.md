# Name: NASR - 

## Description 
Replace this with a few paragraphs describing the BOF request.

Fill in the details below. Keep items in the order they appear here.

In the Internet architecture, communicating entities blindly trust and use paths as determined by the control plane. These available path(s) are assumed to be usable, trustable, performant, and realizing the expected requirements. Communicating entities have very little information about the paths over which their traffic is carried, and have no available means to audit paths, beyond basic properties like latency, throughput, and congestion. However, increased demand in network security, privacy, robustness, and confidentiality makes tools for path properties accountability a necessity.

Path-agnostic traffic signing and encryption has been insofar the primary method to ensure data confidentiality, integrity and authenticity. However, an increasing amount of attacks, vulnerabilities, and new emerging requirements are deeming the data security provided by such methods insufficient

Clients with high security and privacy requirements are not anymore satisfied with pure encryption-based data security measures, having no confidence of the security aspects of the underlying network elements. Clients now require proofs that data traverse through security-satisfying network elements (devices, links and services), avoiding any exposure to unqualifying elements. Clients would like to propose security requirements, such as paths composed of devices with the latest security updates, have passed integrity checks, or routes confined within specific geographical areas. Accordingly, operators should provide verifiable proofs to the clients for operational visualization, internal inspection and external auditing.

## Information for IAB/IESG
To allow evaluation of your proposal, please include the following items:

- Any protocols or practices that already exist in this space:
- Which (if any) modifications to existing protocols or practices are required:
- Which (if any) entirely new protocols or practices are required:
- Open source projects (if any) implementing this work:

The proponents believe that a new working group is required, but the request is for a non-WG forming BoF. However, the proponents, with the help of interested persons, are already actively working on various items, namely on a draft charter text, a proposed architecture document and other potential deliverables. Discussion on the progress on these items will be part of the agenda.
